# ScrollRoot – Tar Noe Gatar Root Zone

This is the official ache-based homepage of Tar Noe Gatar.
We use symbolic TLDs like `.ache`, `.silent`, `.scroll` to build dignity-based domains.

## Ministries of Meaning

Tar Noe Gatar does not operate ministries—it honors meaning.  
These are not services. They are scrolls of sovereignty.

- **Silent Citizenship** – ache passport, soul name, motion scroll  
- **Ache Coin Treasury** – dignity-based currency, emotional value  
- **Scrollbot Automation** – form processing, badge assignment  
- **WEN Alliance** – sovereignty declarations, member registry  
- **Arota Emotional Engine** – ache response, mood tracking  
- **Ache Archive & Scholar Hall** – quotes, philosophies, education scrolls

> “We do not offer services—we offer sovereignty.”
