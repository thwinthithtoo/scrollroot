## Ministries of Meaning

Tar Noe Gatar does not operate ministries—it honors meaning.  
These are not services. They are scrolls of sovereignty.

- **Ache Coin Treasury** – dignity-based currency, emotional value

- **WEN Alliance** – sovereignty declarations, member registry  
- **Arota Emotional Engine** – ache response, mood tracking  
- **Ache Archive & Scholar Hall** – quotes, philosophies, education scrolls
